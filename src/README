HISTORY

 After getting my server linked to Undernet, I had some ideas about
 having a bot, not like the others, but more like looking after what
 the server is doing, how many users connecting, and it's general
 healthy. Then I wrote the original GenEthic bot, which was not desgined
 for portability to another server, all it functions were 'hardcoded'
 and so on. That's why I decided to rewrite it completly and that's also
 why you are reading this now ;-P


REQUIREMENTS

 Operating System requirements:

    - perl 5.004 or better
    - perl IO:Socket module
    - web server (optional)
    - MRTG (optional)

 IRC Server requirements:

    - Running ircu2.10.11.06 (available at http://coder-com.undernet.org)
      note: this bot is NOT compatible with any other IRC daemon!
    - An o line(local oper) for the bot.
    - An I line with password (recommended but optional).
    - An Y line with at least 3Mbytes of SendQ.
    - Enable the following features in your ircd.conf:

        F:OPER_MODE_LCHAN:TRUE
        F:OPER_WALK_THROUGH_LMODES:TRUE
        F:SHOW_INVISIBLE_USERS:TRUE
        F:SHOW_ALL_INVISIBLE_USERS:TRUE
        F:UNLIMIT_OPER_QUERY:TRUE
        F:LOCOP_LGLINE:TRUE
        F:LOCOP_WIDE_GLINE:TRUE
        F:OPER_KILL:TRUE
        F:LOCOP_SEE_IN_SECRET_CHANNELS:TRUE
        F:NO_OPER_DEOP_LCHAN:TRUE
        F:CONNEXIT_NOTICES:TRUE

        If you dont enable all of these features the bot may work,
        but for sure not at 100% of its capacity.

	NOTE: All those F:Lines are compatible with the actual Undernet
              policy.

 Compatibility with the Undernet Policy:

     NOTE: If you do not follow the rules described below,
           you may have your server delinked!

     You MUST announce to the admins mailing list the fact that
     you have added a new local oper, even if it's a bot!

     The bot is reporting confidential (oper only) informations.
     You must ensure the security of the bot's home directory and
     any other possible access to the bot.

INSTALLATION

 Simply run the configuration software:

     ./install <absolute_path_to_install> [--force]

     --force   force the creation of the directory

 Example:

     ./install /home/genethic

 Once the installation is done, edit the configuration file,
 take your time, dont stress, it should be understandable for
 any OPER/ADMIN with some experience. Everything is explained
 for each option of the configuration file.

    cd /path/to/genethic/etc
    cp sample.conf genethic.conf
    vi genethic.conf


UNDERSTANDING BOT CHANNEL OUTPUT

 Once your bot is running it will output some informations to the
 channel every 5 minutes (may be changed in the config).

 Example:

   -bot:@&channel- @ 6454(5.60%)/115338 (+208/-246). No 4/29. 48620(+9)chans, 67 unknown
   -bot:@&channel- @ RPING  -> hub1:973 hub2:86 hub3:186 hub_link 4d6h46m (h69.eu)
   -bot:@&channel- @ TRAFFIC-> xl0 904/2471 kbps 1705/1599 pps xl1 209/49 kbps 52/38 pps

   -bot:@&channel- @ 5492(4.28%)/128036 (+147/-118). No 15/26. 47175(-22)chans, ircu 16 days, 6:11:37
   -bot:@&channel- @ RPING-> h54.eu:140 h22.eu:96 h69.eu:182 h12.eu:148 h25.eu:229 h51.us:353, hub_link 2d15h0m (h22.eu)

   on the first line, in the order the fields appear:

     - number of users on the local server
     - percentage of local users compared to global users
     - number of global users
     - number of users who connected in the last 5 minutes
     - number of users who disconnected in the last 5 minutes
     - position of the local server (regarding the amount of users)
     - number of global server (having at least 5 users)
     - number of channels
     - number of more/less channels since 5 minutes
     - number of unknown connections (as seen in /LUSERS)

  on the second line:

     - last received rping results of all the hubs configured in your
       server config. values are in miliseconds.
     - the hub name which you're currectly connected to and the uptime of this link.

  on the third line(1):

     - traffic status for all the local interfaces(2). its always shown in the
       format in/out, first 'kbps' then 'pps' (packets per second).
       (1) actually only Linux and FreeBSD will display this line.
       (2) on Linux all eth* interfaces. on FreeBSD all interfaces except lo and gif. 


USAGE OF THE BOT

 Once everything is correctly configured, the bot should take place in
 its local channel. The channel is set in +i (invite only) mode. To be
 able to join the channel, just do '/join &channel OVERRIDE'. For sure
 you need to be OPER to do it ;-P Then the bot will authenticate you
 automaticly. You can talk to the bot by PRIVMSG or NOTICE.
 The bot will also INVITE you to the channel as soon as you use the
 OPER command.

 Once in the channel you may communicate with the bot. Most of the stuff
 happens thru the DCC interface. simply '/msg bot dcc' and the bot will
 start a dcc. you'll need a password to connect to the dcc and it will
 be given by the bot in the channel.
 -> *bot* dcc
 -bot:@&channel- @ your_nickname requested DCC, code is xy
 note: if you're running mIRC and you're tired of copying the code from
       the channel to the DCC, add this to your 'REMOTE' commands.

on 1:NOTICE:*:&channel:{
  if ( $me $+ ?requested?DCC??code?is iswm $2-6 ) {
    .timerDCC1 4 1 .echo = $+ $nick mIRC Script: Please wait, your password will be sent to the session in a few seconds
    .timerDCC2 1 5 .msg = $+ $nick $7
    halt
  }
}

 On another side the bot is putting information into a file at each
 update (as defined by configuration) in var/genethic.log You can use
 the informations in this file to do some MRTG Graphs or others...
 A tool has especially been written for that. look into your 'bin'
 directory and you'll see 'runmrtg.pl'. just run this script and you'll
 have nice and cool graphs setup in the 'mrtg' directory. Then you can
 simply copy the 'mrtg' directory using an ftp script or whatever to your
 favorite website. Be SURE to protect the graphs. kiddies love to see
 the graphs drawing buildings while they attack your server!

 And now, HAVE FUN!
